* trigger should decide the index level (consistent with grow_atom, i.e. which modules to grow), arch just duplicate that level that's all (thus only needs grow_atom)
* plus operation is tricky, duplicate which one?
    * maybe the middle one? (duplicate_times+1) // 2, each time add a 3-3-3

* may need smooth, temporacy current err dominate
